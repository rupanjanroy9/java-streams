        String content = "Kia's \"top down\" approach to India has proven effective. It's a bargain brand in many countries, but has a certain allure in India. Launching the fully-loaded Seltos & 35-lakh Carnival first, and then the Sonet has its benefits. Strategy wouldn't have been as effective the other way around (i.e. if the Sonet was launched first).\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• The Sonet is a handsome car and looks like nothing else in the segment. It is easy to recognize as a Kia with the company’s signature “tiger nose” grille.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Body cladding, roof rails, skid plates and flared wheel arches give this Compact SUV a rugged appearance.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Chrome has been used around the foglamps, on the door handles and the window line. It’s only the application on the door handles that looks overdone & after-market-type.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Like the Seltos & Creta, this is almost identical to the Venue under the skin.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• The car draws a lot of attention on the road. Car owners, bikers, pedestrians etc. all turned around to check out our test car. Some drivers and riders even changed course to get a closer look at it.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Like the Seltos, the Sonet will be available in 2 variant categories – Tech Line and GT Line. Both categories will come in 3 variants - HTE / GTE, HTK / GTK and HTX / GTX, where E stands for Energy, K for Klass and X for eXtreme.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• GT Line gets red highlights on the grille, bumpers, body cladding and alloy wheels. Opinions about these are divided.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• The Sonet's wheels are the right size (16”). But the 215/60 section MRF Wanderer tyres lack grip & are typical...well, MRFs. We recommend an upgrade as soon as delivery of the car is taken.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Interior - Front\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Ingress & egress are easy for all, including the elderly, thanks to the comparatively low floor and high roof.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• All-black interiors go well with the sporty external appearance of the Sonet. The cabin looks modern and with the times. Red contrast stitching lends a youthful look to the interiors.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• While black will be easier to live with and keep from getting soiled, a lighter shade would have given an airier feel. This all-black cabin does feel tight at the front & claustrophobic at the rear. A dual-tone black & beige theme is available, but you have to opt for the Tech Line for that.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• All plastics used in the cabin are hard, yet of good quality. The leatherette inserts on the doorpads are the only soft material used. All the \"touch points\" (including the steering) have good quality materials.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Piano black and silver inserts at various places give the dashboard a classy appearance.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Ergonomics are spot on. Everything is exactly where it is expected to be and easy to reach. This is typical of Hyundais & now Kia.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Cabin width is fair for a compact SUV; it’s not quite as wide as the Tata Nexon though.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Frontal visibility is compromised for short drivers so, if you are one, be warned. The high dashboard & curvy bonnet are responsible here.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Flat-bottom, leather steering with thumb contours has the right thickness and is a joy to hold. It comes with rake adjustment, but cannot be adjusted for reach. The Ford EcoSport remains the only sub-4m crossover to offer that very-useful feature.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Like I’ve earlier observed in Hyundai–Kia cars, there are too many buttons on the steering wheel. There will be times when you press the wrong button.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Digital speedometer gives an accurate reading, but the revv-counter is C-shaped and its difficult to tell the exact rpm level. MID relays enough information and thankfully, analogue fuel and temperature gauges have been provided.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Leather-wrapped gear shifter (with unlock button on the right) looks very upmarket.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Pedals are well-positioned and the footwell is spacious. Dead pedal is useful.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Driver’s seat has sufficient support. It gets height adjustment, but not lumbar adjustment. It’s got some bolstering on the sides, yet is sufficiently wide.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Leatherette upholstery is of fine quality. Stitching is consistent. Ventilated front seats are a boon in the hot climatic conditions of India.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Lots of storage spaces and cubby holes in the cabin. Apart from the regular cupholders and door pockets, you get umbrella holders on the front doorpads and a slot below the handbrake - between the two cupholders to store a smartphone or the car’s key fob. Even a sunglass holder is provided.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Driver armrest is positioned too far behind. At 5’10”, I found it difficult to use. Shorter drivers will find it completely useless. It should have been extendable.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Powerful air-con chills the interiors in no time.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Design of the air-con console is a love it / hate it affair.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Sunroof is a very welcome feature. It is electrically operated with a manual cover and reasonably sized.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Like the Seltos, the 10.25” touchscreen head-unit looks like an extension of the instrument cluster. It is responsive to use and has an easy-to-understand user interface.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Sound quality from the 7-speaker Bose sound system is very good and enjoyable, especially by compact SUV standards. I'll give it a 5-star rating.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• The Sonet is equipped with 6 airbags, ABS with EBD, ESC, HAC, VSM, brake assist, front and rear parking sensors, ISOFIX child seat anchors and a driving rear view monitor.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Like the Seltos, the Sonet comes with an air purifier. It further gets some virus and bacteria protection.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "• Another party piece is the remote \"engine start\" feature which can be operated by using the key fob or EVO smartphone app.";
